- 👋 Hi, I’m @qudent - [blog](https://qudent.github.io), but an organized overview of my writing is in this file.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
   - in progress: [Quantifying progress in neuroscience](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/06/intro-neuroscience-progress-studies/) - with [Kevin Kermani Nejad](https://bristolcnu.github.io/people/RPC_kevin_nejad/index.html), ETA 09/22
   - in alpha: [a new variant of the adversary bound - quantum query algorithm duality](https://github.com/qudent/RhoPaths), ETA 12/22
   - maybe in progress: applications of that duality - with [Alexander Belov](http://home.lu.lv/~belovs/), ETA???
   - not in progress: [formalizing implicit containment of computations](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/04/implicit-computations/)
   - Misc:
      - [Suboptimality in brains](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/06/neuro-stochasticity/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
    - Reinforcement learning - with [Jay Bailey](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jay-bailey-cs)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
    - a data structure that improves upon PDF-from-LaTeX in capturing mathematical writing - mock-up and more details on request.
    - Or, maybe, whatever interests you!

Reviews
-------
If you think I can do something for you, please reach out! Some past reviews:

"I consulted Duyal regarding an ML engineering problem related to supervised clustering of data, and was quickly presented with an algorithm inspired by the word2vec/skip-gram with negative sampling techniques." - [Davide Zagami](https://davidezagami.github.io/)

"Duyal replied to an algorithm bounty for a problem I previously considered very difficult: Cohort scheduling based on participant and facilitator availability. Duyal quickly came up with a rephrasing of the problem as an integer linear programming problem, leading to a practical solution using an efficient solver - besides proving NP-completeness of that rephrasing, showing that such a solver was necessary."

"For my research into AI timelines I wanted to understand a neuroscience paper quickly, despite lacking expertise. Duyal quickly responded to my bounty request, skimmed the paper, and put it into context for me, giving me the info I needed." - [Daniel Kokotajlo](https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/daniel-kokotajlo/)

Longer-form references and a CV on request.
