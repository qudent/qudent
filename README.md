- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Duyal - [blog](https://qudent.github.io), but an organized overview of my writing is in this file.
- üëÄ My work ...
   - **A new variant of the quantum adversary bound - query algorithm duality**
      - [The Adversary Bound Revisited: From Optimal Query Algorithms to Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16293). This contains a new universal algorithm witnessing tightness of the quantum adversary bound that works by "guessing" a convenient initial state and tracking permissible evolutions of reduced density operators in the style of [Barnum-Saks-Szegedy](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1214419). It generalizes the duality from query algorithms to a certain quantum time-optimal control problem. This approach has certain other advantages compared to the old one based on phase detection as well, see the article.
      - [One-Way Ticket to Las Vegas and the Quantum Adversary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02003), with [Alexander Belov](http://home.lu.lv/~belovs/), presented as a short plenary talk at [QIP 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1175020/). This paper focusses on query algorithms and a new notion of quantum query complexity, called _quantum Las Vegas complexity_, that may be analyzed using this universal query algorithm. Compared to the previous item, the algorithm's exposition (Theorem 7.5) is different, and Theorem 7.11 finds error-free algorithms. Computer scientists seem to prefer this presentation.
   - **[The R-algebra of Quasiknowledge and Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04606), looking for applications.** This is inspired by Barnum-Saks-Szegedy as well, attempting to generalize the way they track a query algorithm's state using reduced density/Gram matrices to classical probabilistic computers/controllers or those that hold mixed quantum states. The essential idea is to arrive at the notion of "reduced density matrix" in a nonstandard way, as "an equivalence class of pure quantum states, with states being equivalent if they can be transformed into each other by acting only on the subspaces that are being traced out". One may re-define algebraic structures on reduced density matrices relevant for BSS/the adversary bound (addition, partial order, entrywise products, partial trace, subtraction) in terms of these equivalence classes as well. Then it's easy to perform analogous constructions starting from classical probability vectors or mixed quantum states, and we may derive optimization problems analogous to those in BSS/the papers above. There are some gaps though at the moment (for example, I don't understand whether/how convex duality works).

Hire me/Reviews
-------
**If you think I can do something for you, please reach out!** Some past reviews of things I did:

### Engineering
"I consulted Duyal regarding an ML engineering problem related to supervised clustering of data, and was quickly presented with an algorithm inspired by the word2vec/skip-gram with negative sampling techniques." - [Davide Zagami](https://davidezagami.github.io/)

"Duyal replied to an algorithm bounty for a problem I previously considered very difficult: Cohort scheduling based on participant and facilitator availability. Duyal quickly came up with a rephrasing of the problem as an integer linear programming problem, leading to a practical solution using an efficient solver - besides proving NP-completeness of that rephrasing, showing that such a solver was necessary."

### Science
"When I was trying to replicate a reinforcement learning paper, Duyal was able to provide some great information about what resources I could access to understand the subject faster and learn more. I didn't realise how much supplementary material can be out there for academic papers, and Duyal had the background to show me those things and save me a lot of time." - [Jay Bailey](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jay-bailey-cs)

"For my research into AI timelines I wanted to understand a neuroscience paper quickly, despite lacking expertise. Duyal quickly responded to my bounty request, skimmed the paper, and put it into context for me, giving me the info I needed." - [Daniel Kokotajlo](https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/daniel-kokotajlo/)

"Duyal gave excellent feedback on one of our scripts. We ended up changing a few things thanks to his insights." - [Rational Animations](https://www.youtube.com/RationalAnimations)
