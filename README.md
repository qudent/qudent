- 👋 Hi, I’m @qudent - [blog](https://qudent.github.io)
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
   - in progress: [Quantifying progress in neuroscience](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/06/intro-neuroscience-progress-studies/) - with [Kevin Kermani Nejad](https://bristolcnu.github.io/people/RPC_kevin_nejad/index.html), ETA 2 months
   - in alpha: [a new variant of the adversary bound - quantum query algorithm duality](https://github.com/qudent/RhoPaths), ETA 6 months
   - maybe in progress: applications of that duality - with [Alexander Belov](http://home.lu.lv/~belovs/), ETA???
   - not in progress: [formalizing implicit containment of computations](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/04/implicit-computations/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
    - a data structure that improves upon PDF-from-LaTeX in capturing mathematical writing - mock-up and more details on request.
    - Or, maybe, whatever interests you!

If you think I can do something for you, please reach out! Some past reviews:

"I consulted Duyal regarding an ML engineering problem related to supervised clustering of data, and was quickly presented with an algorithm inspired by the word2vec/skip-gram with negative sampling techniques." - [Davide Zagami](https://davidezagami.github.io/)

Longer-form references and a CV on request.
