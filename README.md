- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Duyal - [blog](https://qudent.github.io), but an organized overview of my writing is in this file.
- üëÄ My work ...
   - [A general framework for states of knowledge](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/08/convex-knowledge.html), looking for applications
   - [a new variant of the adversary bound - quantum query algorithm duality](https://github.com/qudent/RhoPaths)
   - Applications of that duality - with [Alexander Belov](http://home.lu.lv/~belovs/), upcoming
   - not in progress:
      - [formalizing implicit containment of computations](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/04/implicit-computations/)
      - [Quantifying progress in neuroscience](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/06/intro-neuroscience-progress-studies/) - with [Kevin Kermani Nejad](https://bristolcnu.github.io/people/RPC_kevin_nejad/index.html)

   - Misc:
      - [Suboptimality in brains](https://qudent.github.io/posts/2022/06/neuro-stochasticity/)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
    - a data structure that improves upon PDF-from-LaTeX in capturing mathematical writing - mock-up and more details on request.
    - Or, maybe, whatever interests you!
- üì´ How to reach me ...
   - live chat on my [blog](https://qudent.github.io) - works for anonymous feedback as well, if you use a VPN

Hire me/Reviews
-------
**If you think I can do something for you, please reach out!** Some past reviews of things I did:

### Engineering
"I consulted Duyal regarding an ML engineering problem related to supervised clustering of data, and was quickly presented with an algorithm inspired by the word2vec/skip-gram with negative sampling techniques." - [Davide Zagami](https://davidezagami.github.io/)

"Duyal replied to an algorithm bounty for a problem I previously considered very difficult: Cohort scheduling based on participant and facilitator availability. Duyal quickly came up with a rephrasing of the problem as an integer linear programming problem, leading to a practical solution using an efficient solver - besides proving NP-completeness of that rephrasing, showing that such a solver was necessary."

### Science
"When I was trying to replicate a reinforcement learning paper, Duyal was able to provide some great information about what resources I could access to understand the subject faster and learn more. I didn't realise how much supplementary material can be out there for academic papers, and Duyal had the background to show me those things and save me a lot of time." - [Jay Bailey](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jay-bailey-cs)

"For my research into AI timelines I wanted to understand a neuroscience paper quickly, despite lacking expertise. Duyal quickly responded to my bounty request, skimmed the paper, and put it into context for me, giving me the info I needed." - [Daniel Kokotajlo](https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/daniel-kokotajlo/)

"Duyal gave excellent feedback on one of our scripts. We ended up changing a few things thanks to his insights." - [Rational Animations](https://www.youtube.com/RationalAnimations)
